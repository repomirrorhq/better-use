# Session Report - 2025-08-24 Popup Window Handling Fix

## Session Summary
Performed routine maintenance and addressed a new Python issue related to popup window handling.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Popup Window Handling (Python Issue #2639)
- **Issue**: Browser sessions weren't properly closing after interacting with popup windows created via `window.open()`
- **Root Cause**: The TypeScript BrowserSession wasn't listening for the 'page' event on the context to detect new popup windows
- **Solution**: Added `context.on('page')` event handler to track and manage popup windows
- **Impact**: Ensures all popup windows are properly tracked and closed when the session ends

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Created `browser-popup-window-handling.test.ts` with tests for:
  - Proper tracking of popup windows created with `window.open()`
  - Automatic cleanup of all popup windows when browser session stops
  - Correct emission of `tabCreated` and `tabClosed` events for popups
- All tests passing successfully

### 3. Repository Maintenance
- Reviewed 20 open Python issues (up from 10 in previous session)
- Most issues are runtime/configuration problems not affecting TypeScript port
- TypeScript repository remains at 0 open issues
- Python repository still at commit 1173e2c3 (no new code changes)

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
1. **src/browser/session.ts**:
   - Added event listener for popup windows in the `start()` method
   - Popups are now automatically tracked in the `pages` Map
   - Each popup triggers appropriate watchdog events

2. **tests/browser-popup-window-handling.test.ts**:
   - Comprehensive test suite for popup window scenarios
   - Tests both single and multiple popup windows
   - Verifies proper cleanup on session stop

### Python Issues Reviewed
- #2639: Browser remains open after popup window interaction - **FIXED in TypeScript**
- #2694: Search Google logic forcing unwanted searches - Noted for future consideration
- #2687: Missing aiohttp module - Python dependency issue, not applicable to TypeScript
- Other issues mostly runtime/configuration problems

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring Python repository for new updates
2. Address any new GitHub issues in TypeScript repository as they arise
3. Consider improving search behavior to address Python issue #2694
4. Maintain test coverage for new features

## Repository Status
- **Python**: 20 open issues, last commit 1173e2c3
- **TypeScript**: 0 open issues, fully synchronized with Python functionality
- **Build Status**: ✅ Compiling successfully
- **Tests**: ✅ All tests passing including new popup window tests

## Session Duration
Approximately 30 minutes of active development and testing.
