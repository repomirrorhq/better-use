# Session Complete - 2025-08-26

## Summary
Successfully fixed test infrastructure issues and organized the project structure according to Lyndon's notes.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Test Infrastructure Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `_cdpNavigate()` → `navigateToUrl()` with `createNavigateToUrlEvent`
- ✅ Fixed `inputTextElementNode()` → `eventBus.dispatch` with `TypeTextEvent`
- ✅ Updated test imports to use proper event creation functions
- ✅ Installed Playwright browsers

### 2. Code Quality
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ Type checking passes with no errors
- ✅ Basic tests passing (basic.test.ts, tokens.test.ts)
- ⚠️ 609 linting warnings remain (mostly nullish coalescing)

### 3. Project Organization
- ✅ Created proper .agent meta files (global_memory, plan, scratchpad, session_summary, todos)
- ✅ Archived 77 old session files into organized directories
- ✅ Cleaned up .agent directory structure

## Commits Made
1. `72d38b0` - fix: Fix test infrastructure issues
2. `9d7b479` - fix: Replace deprecated test methods with proper API calls
3. `c4306c0` - chore: Organize and archive old agent files

## Remaining Issues (for next session)
- Fix 609 linting warnings (mostly nullish coalescing operators)
- Fix ActionModel test issues
- Some browser tests still hanging/timing out

## Principles Applied (per Lyndon's notes)
- ✅ DRY & KISS principles followed
- ✅ Frequent git commits with clear messages
- ✅ Used .agent directory for meta information
- ✅ Ordered todos with estimates
- ✅ Cleaned up after work (archived old files)
- ✅ Focused 80% on fixes, 20% on testing

## Git Status
