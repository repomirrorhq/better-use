# Session Summary - 2025-08-26

## Accomplishments
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized .agent directory with proper structure
   - Created meta information files (global_memory, todos, plan, scratchpad)
   - Moved old agent files to .agent to preserve history

2. **Test Infrastructure Fixes**
   - Fixed missing module imports (dom/types → dom/views)
   - Created test utilities:
     - `tests/test-utils/domTypes.ts` - DOMNode interface for tests
     - `tests/test-utils/mockLogger.ts` - Mock logger for tests
   - Installed Playwright chromium browser
   - Fixed express import issue in tests

3. **Code Quality**
   - Type checking: ✅ PASSING (no errors)
   - Linting: 608 issues remain (302 errors, 306 warnings)
   - Auto-fixed 6 linting issues

4. **Test Status**
   - Some tests passing: basic.test.ts, tokens.test.ts
   - Browser tests partially working (6/8 passing in browser-session.test.ts)
   - Many tests still need browser installation or other fixes

## Current Issues
1. **Linting** - 302 errors need manual fixing (mostly nullish coalescing and any types)
2. **Test Failures** - Several test suites still failing
3. **Express Import** - Fixed but needs verification across all tests

## Next Steps
1. Fix critical linting errors (nullish coalescing operators)
2. Investigate and fix remaining test failures
3. Run full test suite
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Create pull request with comprehensive changes
