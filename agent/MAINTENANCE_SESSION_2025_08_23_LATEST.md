# Maintenance Session Plan - 2025-08-23

## Current Status Assessment
Based on the comprehensive status files, the browser-use TypeScript port is in an excellent state:

- ✅ **Complete Feature Parity** with Python version achieved
- ✅ **9/9 LLM Providers** fully implemented and tested
- ✅ **Advanced Features** all implemented (logging, cloud events, GIF generation, DOM playground)
- ✅ **Production Ready** with comprehensive test coverage

## Today's Maintenance Objectives

### 1. Health Check & Validation
- Verify compilation status (should be 0 errors)
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Check for any new TypeScript or dependency issues

### 2. Python Source Sync
- Review recent changes in Python repository
- Identify any new features, bug fixes, or improvements to port
- Ensure TypeScript version stays current with Python version

### 3. Dependency Updates
- Check for any critical security updates in npm dependencies
- Update versions where appropriate
- Test after updates to ensure no breaking changes

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update status files to reflect current session
- Ensure README and documentation are current
- Update any outdated information

### 5. Git Hygiene
- Ensure all changes are properly committed
- Push any pending changes
- Clean up any stale branches if needed

## Expected Outcomes
This should be a light maintenance session since the port is already complete and successful. Main focus is ensuring everything stays in good working order and identifying any new features from Python that should be ported.
