# Current Session Plan - Browser-Use TypeScript Maintenance
**Date:** 2025-08-23
**Session Goal:** Continue porting critical missing components from Python to TypeScript

## 📊 Current Status Assessment

### ✅ Already Complete (Previous Sessions)
- **Core Infrastructure:** 100% TypeScript, 0 compilation errors
- **Advanced Features:** Logging, Cloud Events, GIF Generation, DOM Playground  
- **LLM Providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Gemini, AWS Bedrock (4/9)
- **Test Coverage:** 53/53 tests passing (100%)
- **Watchdogs:** Basic set (Crash, Security, Downloads)

### 🎯 Session Priorities (Based on Enterprise Impact)

## Priority 1: Azure OpenAI Provider (3-4 hours)
**Why:** Critical for enterprise customers using Azure infrastructure
**Python Source:** `browser_use/llm/azure/chat.py`
**Target Location:** `src/llm/providers/azure.ts`
**Expected Output:** Complete Azure provider with structured output and vision support

## Priority 2: CLI Interface (2-3 hours)
**Why:** Basic usability requirement - users can't currently run the tool from command line
**Python Source:** `browser_use/cli.py`  
**Target Location:** `src/cli.ts`
**Expected Output:** Full command-line interface with argument parsing and help

## Priority 3: Additional LLM Provider (Pick 1)
**Options:** Deepseek, Groq, or Ollama
**Why:** Expand user choice and market coverage
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours per provider

## Priority 4: Enhanced Watchdogs (If time allows)
**Options:** PermissionsWatchdog, PopupsWatchdog
**Why:** Improve browser automation reliability
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours per watchdog

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach:
1. **Study Python implementation** - Understand existing patterns
2. **Create TypeScript equivalent** - Follow existing TS patterns in the repo
3. **Add comprehensive tests** - Maintain 100% test coverage
4. **Commit immediately after each file** - Follow instructions
5. **Update documentation** - Keep agent/ directory current

### Quality Standards:
- ✅ 0 TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ 100% test coverage for new components  
- ✅ Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- ✅ Professional commit messages with Claude Code attribution
- ✅ Push changes immediately after each commit

## 📈 Success Metrics for This Session

### Minimum Success:
- ✅ Azure OpenAI provider implemented and tested
- ✅ CLI interface functional for basic usage
- ✅ All existing tests still passing
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors

### Stretch Goals:
- ✅ One additional LLM provider (Deepseek, Groq, or Ollama)
- ✅ One enhanced watchdog
- ✅ Updated gaps analysis showing progress

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

By end of session:
- **LLM Provider Count:** 4 → 5-6 providers
- **Enterprise Readiness:** Significant improvement with Azure support
- **Usability:** Major improvement with CLI interface
- **Test Coverage:** Maintained at 100%
- **Technical Debt:** Reduced by following established patterns

## 🔄 Next Session Preparation

Document in agent/ directory:
- What was accomplished this session
- Remaining gaps and priorities  
- Any technical challenges or patterns discovered
- Updated roadmap for future sessions

## 📋 Session Execution Plan

1. **Start with Azure OpenAI Provider** (highest enterprise impact)
2. **Implement CLI interface** (biggest usability improvement)
3. **Add one more provider** if time allows
4. **Commit and push after each major component**
5. **Update status documentation in agent/**

This plan focuses on high-impact enterprise features while maintaining the established quality standards and development practices.
