   - Enterprise collaboration features

8. **OpenRouter Provider** (2 days)
   - Multi-provider routing capabilities

9. **Enhanced Observability** (4 days)
   - Production monitoring and metrics

## 🚀 Current Session Goals

### Primary Objective: Complete Azure OpenAI Provider
**Target**: Implement production-ready Azure OpenAI provider with:
- Multi-deployment support (different endpoints/keys)
- API versioning (2023-12-01-preview, etc.)
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Structured output with tool calling
- Vision support for GPT-4 Vision
- Comprehensive test coverage (15+ tests)
- Full integration with existing Agent/Controller

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Zero compilation errors
- ✅ All existing tests still pass (53/53)  
- ✅ New Azure provider tests pass (15+ new tests)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- ✅ Error handling for Azure-specific issues
- ✅ Documentation and example usage

### Secondary Objective: Start CLI Interface  
If time permits after Azure provider completion:
- Basic CLI entry point with argument parsing
- Integration with existing Agent and Controller
- Support for common use cases (single task execution)

## 📋 Session Tasks

### Phase 1: Azure OpenAI Provider (Est. 2-3 hours)
1. ✅ Analyze Python Azure OpenAI implementation
2. ✅ Design TypeScript Azure provider structure
3. ✅ Implement core Azure OpenAI chat functionality
4. ✅ Add structured output and tool calling support  
5. ✅ Implement vision support for GPT-4V
6. ✅ Create comprehensive test suite
7. ✅ Integrate with existing systems
8. ✅ Test end-to-end functionality
9. ✅ Commit and document changes

### Phase 2: CLI Interface (If time permits)
1. ✅ Analyze Python CLI implementation  
2. ✅ Design TypeScript CLI structure with argument parsing
3. ✅ Implement basic task execution flow
4. ✅ Add configuration file support
5. ✅ Create help documentation
6. ✅ Test CLI with various scenarios
7. ✅ Commit and document changes

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Maintain 0 compilation errors, 100% test coverage
- **Functionality**: Azure provider feature parity with Python version
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing TypeScript codebase
- **Performance**: No regression in existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Clear usage examples and API documentation

## 🎯 Long-term Roadmap Impact
Completing the Azure OpenAI provider will:
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Support for all 3 major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google)
- **Market Coverage**: Address 95%+ of enterprise AI infrastructure setups  
- **Competitive Position**: Match and exceed Python version capabilities
- **Adoption Acceleration**: Remove major barrier for Azure-based organizations

This session focuses on **high-impact, enterprise-critical functionality** that directly addresses adoption barriers and maintains the project's momentum toward production readiness.
