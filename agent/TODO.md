# Browser-Use TypeScript Port - TODO List

**Date:** 2025-08-23
**Status:** Active Porting & Maintenance Session

## Current Session Overview

This is an active porting and maintenance session for the browser-use TypeScript repository. The goal is to maintain feature parity with the Python version and keep the TypeScript implementation up-to-date.

## Project Status Assessment

Based on the current repository state, the TypeScript port appears to have substantial implementation already:

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- Core project structure with TypeScript configuration
- Package.json with comprehensive dependencies
- Agent system with message management
- Browser session management with Playwright integration
- DOM serialization and manipulation
- LLM providers (Anthropic, AWS, Azure, DeepSeek, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- Browser watchdogs system
- CLI interfaces (simple and advanced)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) client/server
- Examples directory with comprehensive usage patterns
- Test framework setup with Jest
- Cloud events and telemetry
- Screenshots and GIF generation
- File system integration
- Gmail integration
- Sync and authentication services
- Token management

### üîç Areas Requiring Assessment
- Feature parity analysis with Python version
- Test coverage completeness
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes and edge cases

## Current Session Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis & Gap Assessment
1. **Compare Python vs TypeScript feature sets**
   - Analyze core functionality differences
   - Identify missing features or implementations
   - Review API compatibility

2. **Review existing TypeScript implementation**
   - Code quality assessment
   - Architecture review
   - Performance analysis

3. **Test coverage analysis**
   - Review existing tests
   - Identify untested functionality
   - Plan additional test coverage

### Phase 2: Implementation & Updates
1. **Port missing Python features**
   - Prioritize critical missing functionality
   - Maintain API compatibility
   - Ensure proper TypeScript typing

2. **Bug fixes and improvements**
   - Address any identified issues
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code quality improvements

3. **Test development**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Develop end-to-end tests
   - Maintain 80/20 porting vs testing ratio

### Phase 3: Maintenance & GitHub Issues
1. **GitHub issue management**
   - Review and triage open issues
   - Respond to user questions (identify as bot)
   - Implement fixes for reported bugs

2. **Documentation updates**
   - Sync with Python version documentation
   - TypeScript-specific examples
   - API documentation updates

## Development Workflow

- Make commits after every single file edit
- Push changes immediately after commits
- Use browser-use-ts/agent/ as scratchpad for planning
- Track progress in this TODO.md file
- Maintain feature parity with Python version

## Next Steps

1. Begin comprehensive comparison between Python and TypeScript versions
2. Identify specific gaps or missing features
3. Prioritize implementation tasks
4. Start development work with proper testing
