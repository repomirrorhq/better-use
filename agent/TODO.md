## 🐛 Known Issues

### ✅ Dynamic Import Path Resolution - FIXED
**Location:** `/src/browser/session.ts:123-124`

**Fixed:** 2025-08-23 (commit c8ce25b)

**Solution Applied:**
- Replaced dynamic imports with static imports at the top of the file
- Both `npm run build && node dist/cli.js` and `npx ts-node src/cli.ts` now work correctly
- No more "Cannot find module" errors when using ts-node

## 📅 Previous Maintenance Session (Aug 23, 2025 - Session 4)

### Session Summary: MCP Server Mode Fix
- **Time:** Completed
- **Agent:** Claude Code automated maintenance bot
- **Task:** Fix MCP server mode logging issues
- **Result:** Successfully implemented stderr redirection for MCP mode

### Accomplishments
✅ **MCP Server Mode Fix:**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Create TypeScript Fork of CDP-Use
**Priority:** Medium - Enhanced CDP functionality
**Added:** 2025-08-23

**Description:**
Create a TypeScript port/fork of the CDP-Use library to provide native TypeScript support for Chrome DevTools Protocol operations.

**Tasks:**
1. **Clone CDP-Use repository** - Pull the latest CDP-Use Python codebase
2. **Analyze architecture** - Understand the CDP-Use structure and API design
3. **Create TypeScript fork** - Set up new repository "cdp-use-ts" 
4. **Port core functionality** - Convert Python CDP operations to TypeScript
5. **Add type definitions** - Create comprehensive TypeScript types for CDP
6. **Integrate with browser-use-ts** - Replace current CDP wrapper with cdp-use-ts
7. **Add tests** - Ensure full test coverage for CDP operations
8. **Document API** - Create TypeScript-specific documentation

**Benefits:**
- Native TypeScript CDP support with full type safety
- Better integration with browser-use-ts
- Improved developer experience with auto-completion
- Reduced runtime errors through compile-time type checking
- Potential performance improvements over Python-to-JS bridge

**Repository:** `cdp-use-ts` (to be created)
