# Browser-Use TypeScript Port - TODO List

**Date:** 2025-08-23
**Status:** Active Porting & Maintenance Session

## Current Session Overview

This is an active porting and maintenance session for the browser-use TypeScript repository. The goal is to maintain feature parity with the Python version and keep the TypeScript implementation up-to-date.

## Project Status Assessment

Based on the current repository state, the TypeScript port appears to have substantial implementation already:

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- Core project structure with TypeScript configuration
- Package.json with comprehensive dependencies
- Agent system with message management
- Browser session management with Playwright integration
- DOM serialization and manipulation
- LLM providers (Anthropic, AWS, Azure, DeepSeek, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- Browser watchdogs system
- CLI interfaces (simple and advanced)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) client/server
- Examples directory with comprehensive usage patterns
- Test framework setup with Jest
- Cloud events and telemetry
- Screenshots and GIF generation
- File system integration
- Gmail integration
- Sync and authentication services
- Token management

### üîç Areas Requiring Assessment
- Feature parity analysis with Python version
- Test coverage completeness
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes and edge cases

## Current Session Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis & Gap Assessment
1. **Compare Python vs TypeScript feature sets**
   - Analyze core functionality differences
   - Identify missing features or implementations
   - Review API compatibility

2. **Review existing TypeScript implementation**
   - Code quality assessment
   - Architecture review
   - Performance analysis

3. **Test coverage analysis**
   - Review existing tests
   - Identify untested functionality
   - Plan additional test coverage

### Phase 2: Implementation & Updates
1. **Port missing Python features**
   - Prioritize critical missing functionality
   - Maintain API compatibility
   - Ensure proper TypeScript typing

2. **Bug fixes and improvements**
   - Address any identified issues
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code quality improvements

3. **Test development**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Develop end-to-end tests
   - Maintain 80/20 porting vs testing ratio

### Phase 3: Maintenance & GitHub Issues
1. **GitHub issue management**
   - Review and triage open issues
   - Respond to user questions (identify as bot)
   - Implement fixes for reported bugs

2. **Documentation updates**
   - Sync with Python version documentation
   - TypeScript-specific examples
   - API documentation updates

## Development Workflow

- Make commits after every single file edit
- Push changes immediately after commits
- Use browser-use-ts/agent/ as scratchpad for planning
- Track progress in this TODO.md file
- Maintain feature parity with Python version

## Current Session Progress ‚úÖ

### Completed Tasks

1. **‚úÖ FileSystem Integration**
   - Implemented proper FileSystem initialization in Agent service
   - FileSystem is now passed to MessageManager and Controller
   - Added availableFilePaths support from FileSystem.listFiles()
   - Added tests to verify FileSystem integration works correctly

2. **‚úÖ Usage Tracking Implementation** 
   - Integrated TokenCost service for proper usage tracking
   - LLM is automatically registered with TokenCost on Agent creation
   - Agent.getHistory() now returns proper usage statistics
   - Agent.run() includes usage summary in returned history
   - Added tests to verify token cost tracking functionality

3. **‚úÖ SystemPrompt Class Integration**
   - Replaced hardcoded system message with proper SystemPrompt class
   - SystemPrompt supports different modes (flash, thinking, etc.)
   - Properly configured with Agent settings (max_actions_per_step, etc.)

4. **‚úÖ AgentMessagePrompt Implementation**
   - Replaced placeholder MessageManager implementation with proper AgentMessagePrompt
   - MessageManager now uses AgentMessagePrompt.getUserMessage() for state creation
   - Removed outdated placeholder TODO comments

5. **‚úÖ Browser Session Improvements**
   - Implemented scrollToText method with proper text finding logic
   - Fixed ScrollToTextEvent detection (checking 'direction' vs 'scroll_into_view')
   - Added downloadedFiles tracking support
   - Added watchdogs property for integration with download tracking

6. **‚úÖ Event System Enhancements**
   - Added proper event emission from Agent.finalizeStep()
   - Added placeholder support for conversation saving and GIF generation
   - Events are emitted for stepCompleted with relevant data

7. **‚úÖ Testing Infrastructure**
   - Added integration tests for FileSystem functionality
   - Added integration tests for token cost tracking
   - Added tests for scrollToText event handling
   - Tests verify key integration points work correctly

### Resolved TODO Items
- ‚úÖ Agent service FileSystem integration (was: `fileSystem: null, // TODO: Implement FileSystem`)
- ‚úÖ Usage tracking implementation (was: `usage: null, // TODO: Implement usage tracking`)
- ‚úÖ Recent events support (was: `includeRecentEvents: false, // TODO: Implement recent events`)
- ‚úÖ SystemPrompt class usage (was: `// TODO: Implement proper SystemPrompt class`)
- ‚úÖ AgentMessagePrompt implementation (was: `// TODO: Implement AgentMessagePrompt equivalent`)
- ‚úÖ ScrollToText method (was: `// TODO: Implement scrollToText method`)
- ‚úÖ Download tracking infrastructure (was: `// TODO: Implement proper download tracking`)
- ‚úÖ Event emission in finalizeStep (was: `// TODO: Emit events`)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for GitHub Issues** - Continue checking for user-reported bugs or feature requests
2. **Performance Optimization** - Address remaining architectural TODOs as needed
3. **Documentation Updates** - Sync documentation with completed features
4. **Advanced Features** - Implement remaining placeholder features (GIF generation, conversation saving)

---

**Note:** This session has successfully resolved the core TODO items and improved the TypeScript port's functionality. The repository is now in much better shape with proper integration of key components like FileSystem, usage tracking, and improved browser session handling.
