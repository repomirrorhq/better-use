# Current Session Plan - Browser-Use TypeScript Port

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Session Goal:** Complete the porting effort by focusing on testing infrastructure and integration validation

## Current Port Status

### âœ… COMPLETED COMPONENTS
- **Core Infrastructure**: TypeScript setup, configuration system, utilities
- **LLM System**: Complete with OpenAI, Anthropic providers and schema optimization  
- **DOM System**: Complete DOM service with serialization and element detection
- **Agent System**: Complete agent service with message management and prompts
- **Controller System**: Complete action registry with all browser automation actions
- **FileSystem**: Complete file operations with multi-format support

### ðŸŽ¯ SESSION PRIORITIES

#### PRIORITY 1: Testing Infrastructure (80% of effort)
Based on the Python tests in `browser-use/tests/ci/`, we need to port key test categories:

1. **Browser Event Tests** - Critical for action validation
   - Click, type, scroll, navigation events
   - Dropdown and form interaction tests
   - File upload and download tests

2. **Browser Session Tests** - Essential for browser management  
   - Session lifecycle and state management
   - Tab management and navigation
   - Element caching and proxy handling

3. **Controller Tests** - Core functionality validation
   - Action registry and parameter validation
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Domain filtering and action execution

4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflows
   - Agent + Controller + Browser integration
   - LLM provider integration tests
   - FileSystem integration validation

#### PRIORITY 2: Missing Components (20% of effort)
1. **Watchdog Services** - Browser monitoring (missing from current port)
2. **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol support  
3. **Telemetry/Observability** - Usage tracking and metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories by Priority
1. **Unit Tests** (60% of testing effort)
   - Individual component validation
   - Mock external dependencies (browser, LLM APIs)
   - Focus on core logic and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests** (30% of testing effort)  
   - Component interaction validation
   - Real browser automation scenarios
   - LLM provider integration

3. **End-to-End Tests** (10% of testing effort)
   - Complete workflow validation
   - Real-world use case scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

### Test Implementation Plan
1. **Start with browser event tests** - Most critical for automation
2. **Add browser session tests** - Essential for state management  
3. **Implement controller tests** - Validate action execution
4. **Create integration tests** - Ensure components work together

## Expected Outcomes

### By End of Session
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering 80%+ of core functionality
- [ ] Validation that TypeScript port maintains Python functionality  
- [ ] Working examples demonstrating key use cases
- [ ] Documentation of any remaining gaps or issues

### Success Metrics
- All core browser automation actions working correctly
- LLM integration functional with both OpenAI and Anthropic
- File system operations validated
- Session management and state handling verified

## Implementation Notes

### Key Porting Considerations
- Use Jest for all testing (replacing pytest)
- Mock Playwright browser interactions where appropriate
- Maintain async/await patterns from Python asyncio
- Ensure Zod schema validation works correctly
- Validate TypeScript type safety throughout

### Testing Approach
- Focus on functionality over perfect test coverage
- Prioritize tests that validate core automation scenarios
- Use real browser instances sparingly (mainly for integration tests)
- Mock LLM API calls to avoid costs and rate limits

## Next Steps
1. Start with browser event tests - most critical for validation
2. Port key browser session tests for state management
3. Add controller tests for action registry validation  
4. Create integration tests to validate component interaction
5. Commit and push changes after each major test category completion
